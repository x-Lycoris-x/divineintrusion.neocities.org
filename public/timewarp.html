                        <p>Please pardon my dust! Initially, this page was meant to list every available member of the system, but seeing as we're polyfragmented (and due to some obvious safety concerns/some system members wishing to keep their identities private) that quickly became absolutely unworkable as an idea.</p>
                        <p>Instead, we decided to turn it into a page for system members of note, as well as our general overview for our system and hopefully a collection of resources for those who are seeking to learn more about themselves in a healthy(ish) environment.</p>
                        <p title="I wish I could say this disclaimer comes from nowhere, but we've had very Bad experiences with other systems. This is the resulting boundary. Breaking this will result in loss of access to us."><small>Please don't use this page in leu of seeking a professional medical opinion. We are not qualified to provide diagnosis and will absolutely refuse to do so. We are also not therapists, nor are we caretakers. Save for our partner system, we will not be responsible for the mental health of other systems. Please seek a therapist/psychiatrist should the need arise.</small></p>

                    <h2>Trivia (For Fun)</h2>
                    <hr />

                    <h4>When did you discover you were a system?</h4>
                    <p>We found we were a system roughly in the beginning to mid 2020. The exact date is something we weren't exactly paying attention to I'm afraid given the state of the world at the time.</p>

                    <h4>How many of you are there?</h4>
                    <p>Nope. No Way. Absolutely not. I gave up well before we hit 100, and frankly I try not to look for my mental health's sake. I don't imagine <b>all</b> of those listed are even still present, but I have a problem with deleting or archiving things like that because I get anxious that they'll show up by surprise again (shout out to Eddie for repeatedly doing that exact thing and being part of the reason for that paranoia /lh).</p>
                    
                    <h4>Do you have a collective/system name?</h4>
                    <p><large>The Time Warp System!</large></p>
                    <p>We ended up taking that name around the first time we started identifying as one. It was also around the time we watched Rocky Horror Picture Show for the first time, and ngl despite not being entirely present at the time the name stuck.</p>
                    <p>We also ended up going with it because one of our favorite tropes/things to write is time travel (I imagine a lot of systems will get why). It seemed a fitting combination of those two things to us at the time.</p>
                    <p>We actually used to go by the Lichen Garden System, but that was for a very Brief period of time.</p>

                    <h4>What is your guys tag?</h4>
                    <p>The mantle clock emoji is typically our tag! When that isn't available, we tend to go for the 7 o'clock emoji. It's just our favorite number XD</p>
                    <p>🕰️ | 🕖</p>
