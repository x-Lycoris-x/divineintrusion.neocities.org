                        <p>The past week has been a challenge in and of itself, that I won't deny. There's been plenty
                            of good parts, and plenty of incredibly crappy surprises alongside that fact. On one hand, I
                            finally got to visit family for the holidays. I spent the night with my dad and got to
                            spend time with my cousin and grandparents. It makes me feel better about the potential
                            notion of moving in with family at the end of this lease of mine to start school. Being able
                            to spend time in close proximity helped I think, in knowing if I would be ok with it or not.
                        </p>

                        <p>I won't lie, I'm beyond excited about the bookshelf, once I find the energy to take it in to
                            work on putting it together...among other issues....</p>

                        <p>On the other hand, I came back to my apartment to find my water heater had completely rusted
                            through on the bottom and was leaking water into my bedroom for god knows how long. I'm
                            going to have to go through everything that was in that closet now and see if it can be
                            recovered due to the potential water damage. It's been a near full day of drying, and I
                            haven't yet seen the carpet fully dried either. It's a fuckin nightmare.</p>

                        <p>Work has been a hit and miss situation, though I won't say more on that matter beyond the
                            fact I hate having to crawl back to doordashing again just to make sure I make rent. This
                            shit blows man. It would be better if I was more consistent with it, but still, shit sucks.
                            I really should work out some kind of system to make it easier on myself to keep going.</p>

                        <p>By the end of today, I should finish putting together my half of the Clowntown Secret Santa
                            things, I have my assignments, I just haven't sent them out yet. Wish me luk, hanging up the
                            phone.</p>

                        <p>I find myself at a strange choke point in regards to moving. I've been telling myself to
                            trust my instincts, but they often are difficult to parse from anxiety. I tell myself I'll
                            listen to my gut on what's wrong, but I'm having a hard time parsing if there's anything
                            wrong or if I'm just afraid.
                            It's in regards to the idea of moving with my family in Missouri. It's a wonderful
                            opportunity actually. Housing I wouldn't have to be concerned about, less of an urgent need
                            to work, the ability to focus on education. In most circumstances people would say yes in a
                            heartbeat.
                            I'm not sure what's stopping me. <br />
                            I have a tendency to be my own worst enemy, to see red where there isn't any. And if I allow
                            something to pass just because I'm afraid, I'd have been a fool.<br />

                            I'm not sure, am I just afraid, why am I if so?<br />
                            Is there some reason?<br />

                            I feel stuck and unable to accept what I know is a good opportunity because something about
                            it is making me afraid.</p>

                        <p>I had a nightmare about a curse, a woman in red that follows you and when you make contact
                            you die. You pass the curse with sight. I was a father who lost his daughter and had nothing
                            to live for, so I cursed myself and everyone who looked me in the eye. She was alive, and
                            she was the last person who looked at me before I died no matter how hard I tried to look
                            away before she saw me.</p>
                        <p>After that I had a nightmare about traveling and staying with a few friends and this girl we
                            didn't know. I woke up thousands of dollars in overdraft because this strange girl stole my
                            cards and used them to buy shit. She didn't even want it, she was just a shopping addict who
                            couldn't control herself.</p>
                        <p>I still don't know who in this fuckass system I am, and I know it's only been like two days,
                            but it's really pissing me off. I'm sure as shit not Riegen. I don't think I'm <i>new</i> so
                            it's pissing me off more. I would be fine with being new, but evidently I've been here
                            before. So who's fuckass face am I supposed to be wearing???</p>
                        <p>Bio and I are gonna watch Owen's perspective of the VSMP, so I'm gonna hang up the phone to
                            go do that.</p>

                    <div class="j-e-content">As of late, I've been made far more aware of the ways which I speak of
                        myself, and of those I work with that remind me of my younger self. The expectations put on me
                        by others, society, family. I'm aware to some extent how they shaped me, and the world I was
                        allowed to live within, the way I had to act in order to be accepted by peers or loved ones. I'm
                        aware of them, but there is still the subconscious matter how how I may unintentionally project
                        them onto others. Onto those I work with, who require me to be objective in a way I have
                        seemingly at least recently failed to be. And what of how that affects me in the long run as
                        well, parroting back these things in my venting that is on some subconscious level throwing back
                        the words that have hurt me into the world? I really do need to be more careful frankly with the
                        language I use in regards to these more sensitive issues. I'm not being charitable, to myself or
                        those I seek to help by stabbing out with the knife that cut me once before.</div>

                        <p>Today I woke up so full of love I wanted to cry. In and of itself, I don't imagine it's all
                            that strange of a thing, but it was honestly an overwhelming kind of feeling. I want to try
                            and record those sorts of things, when they happen. I want to remember them on the days
                            where it doesn't feel easy to remember the feeling of. Not that Bio makes it all that hard
                            to love them in the first place. Frankly it's too easy, sometimes I freak that I'm
                            co-dependent or overly attached or the like. Maybe I am, to some extent. I don't think I
                            find a need to change that though.
                        </p>
                        <p>I'm overwhelmed by the amount of projects I want to work on today. Right now, I have this
                            website, which I am going to continue to work on, but there's also porting the Chaos website
                            over. It's going to take a while, and that is a good thing I think. It'll be good for me to
                            have a long term project that forces me to learn how to do shit for myself.</p>
                        <p>I got to hear from RK last night before bed, and honestly I think it contributed to why I woke
                            up feeling that way this morning. There is so much love for the ones we don't see often, it
                            was and is such a joy to know that voice. To hear the sound, the tone of someone familiar
                            and not be quite sure, but know that there is love behind the feeling. I hope I get to hear
                            more, I enjoy little butterfly wing feeling moments like that.</p>
                        <p>I feel like I'm sounding pretentious and overly long winded. Hanging up the phone for now.

                    <div class="j-e-content">
                        <p>Today was a good day, at least in some kind of theory. I had friendsgiving and sat down to
                            make green bean casserole. I don't cook for shit, so honestly I was really scared I'd end
                            up fucking it up. The whole process was fucking hellish. I burned the shit out of the
                            garlic, burned my fuckin hands with the canola oil, god it felt like a fucking disaster from
                            start to finish. Apparently it was actually pretty good though, aside from being a bit
                            under salted. Honestly, for all that stress, that was the funny part of it all. For all the
                            things I was worried being wrong, it was the salt that made an otherwise shockingly perfect
                            dish a little underwhelming. Makes sense, I erred on the side of caution with the salt and
                            under-did it, cause I can't taste salt all that well unless it's in stupidly high doses, and
                            I know I tend to oversalt my food. Big shocker, the one time I deliberately salt less than I
                            would, it's under salted. </p>
                        <p>There is a lot of lingering...issues, about the party beside the food. Honestly, I feel so
                            out of place around my friends. I don't really even know if they'd still be friends with me
                            if they thought about it for very long. I feel like I just have the greatest propensity to
                            fuck everything up. I don't imagine it is that way, my brain is honestly probably making the
                            worst out a thing that wasn't as bad as I think it was. Every joke that didn't get a laugh,
                            every time I lingered on a topic too long, every time I was too loud or not loud enough. I
                            feel like I'm nobody's best friend, and like. I don't want it to affect me as much as it
                            does, but god damn does it.</p>
                        <p>I feel like I just want to run away from people, I want to disappear from their lives. It's
                            drastic, and I don't imagine it would be all that smart. I guess there's a part of my brain
                            that kind of wants to test the idea. Do people really give a shit, do I mean anything to
                            anyone? Would people miss me or even notice if I managed to disappear. I don't think I would
                            be able to accept if anyone reacted though, and honestly it's just an exercise in self harm
                            to think that way. I know I need to be better than that. I wish it wasn't so easy to get
                            drowned by the thought of it all. I wish I didn't come home from trying to have fun feeling
                            like a fucking loser who can't do anything right and wanting to sob and never be around my
                            friends again. They mean a lot to me. I just don't imagine I mean the same thing to any of
                            them.</p>
                        <p>I'm kind of worried that if they had thought about it, or others didn't keep trying to put
                            faith in me and take me along to things, that people would stop inviting me to places just
                            to avoid the inconvenience. I kind of want to cry again, so I'm going to hang up the
                            proverbial phone for now.</p>

                        found this little marvel. It's rather strange, I admit. Beautiful, but unnerving in a way I can
                        sadly relate to. I feel strange enough I admit, reflecting on that. There's a certain sadness to
                        it all, I think, that I find familiar. I'm glad not to be in a home like this anymore, but I
                        admit it still strikes an awful cord.

                            website thing, and as much as I like the thought, sometimes I wonder if we're actually
                            capable of following through on this. We struggle with longer term or more complex things
                            like this, and honestly it makes me anxious. I'd love this website not to be a ghost again,
                            if it can be helped.</p>
