                    <h3>What is a webring?</h3>
                    <p>A webring is a collection of linked sites sharing a common theme — in this case, fans of the Spirit Hunter series developed by Experience Inc. The idea is that one can browse between sites in a circular style via the
                    ring widget.</p>

                    <h3>What is Spirit Hunter?</h3>
                    <p><a href="https://www.spirit-hunter.us/"><strong>Spirit Hunter</strong></a> is a horror adventure
                    series developed and published by Experience Inc. beginning with the first game: <a
                        href="https://www.aksysgames.com/deathmark/"><strong>Death Mark</strong></a> in June of 2017
                    for the PS Vita in Japan. The series explores a primarily visual novel adventure, as one clears
                    the various stages by investigating a rumor regarding a spirit, and then eliminating said spirit
                    (either by saving, or destroying them). Following its worldwide port to various systems via a
                    partnership with Aksys Games, the sequels: <a href="https://www.aksysgames.com/ng/"><strong>NG
                            (No Good)</strong></a> and <a href="https://www.aksysgames.com/deathmark2/"><strong>Death Mark II</strong></a>
                    were also
                    slated for translation and a western release after 2018.</p>

                            <blockquote style="text-align:center; border:solid;">The Spirit Hunter series is a game which contains mature
                                themes/content, and I do not feel that as much as I love this series, that minors should be shown it. <br />
                        
                                Moreover, as adult/mature sites can be listed in this directory, I would not be comfortable listing minors
                                alongside sites containing mature/adult content.
                        
                                Adults have a responsibility to look out for the minors in our communities by creating barriers to entry for
                                vulnerable parties. <br />
                                Feel free to come back when you're older if you don't meet the criteria now!</blockquote>
