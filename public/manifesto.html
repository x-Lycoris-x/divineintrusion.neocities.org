                    <h1>Website Manifesto</h1>
                    <p>In all frankness, I barely understand the base concept of a site manifesto.<br /> A reason to
                        make something, a reason for a thing to exist. A document containing the manifest hopes and
                        dreams riding on a project. A statement of intent. <br /> A lot of the reasons listed here, to
                        make this website, are incredibly personal. They will not resonate with everyone hwo reads them,
                        but they truly don't have to.<br /> I simply keep mine here to view, for posterity to myself and
                        hopefully a source of inspiration for others.<br />
                        I think if you want to do something like this, or hell just start any kind of long term project,
                        it's always important to examine your reasons for starting things.<br />
                        It can be easy for me to lose my way sometimes, and I hope to leave this behind as a little
                        crumb trail to bring me home on the days where it's hard to continue things. <br />
                        As much as I <i>want</i> to have a lot to say and make some deep, introspective essay about it,
                        I honestly will probably keep to simpler terms if only to get my point out there.

                                <p>
                                    Over the years, I've had the desire to start quite a few creative projects. The key
                                    word in that statement is <u>desire</u>. Despite that fact, I have an incredibly
                                    difficult time taking those first steps when I'm unsure of my own ability to follow
                                    through.
                                    <br />
                                    In some regard, there's probably some undiagnosed shit that's making it more
                                    difficult, but I cannot and will not have that be the crux of my inability to do
                                    something.
                                    <br />
                                    It provides me a larger confident boost to work on things in the future when I can
                                    link back to the tangible products of my work. This will be one such example to me,
                                    something I can physically interact with as proof to myself that I can do something
                                    that requires time, immense effort, and to gain a level of mastery over a new skill
                                    or medium.
                                </p>

                                    Over the years, I've found that one of the most effective motivators for me to work
                                    on things that I may have difficulty with, is pure unadulterated <i>spite</i>. That
                                    and stress, but I'm not about to make a thing that I'm supposed to enjoy a source of
                                    suffering.<br />
                                    When I feel like I'm not only giving myself joy, but <i>actively</i> giving the
                                    middle finger to someone or something else in my way? Mwah~, chef's kiss~<br />
                                    Here's to me working through my self esteem issues via the power of html, css, and
                                    javascript.
                                </p>
                            </div>

                        <h3>A need to overshare all the time forever</h3>
                        <div class="scrollbox">
                            <p>
                                So, unsurprising to anyone who knows me, I have a deeply rooted thing with
                                oversharing/sharing at volumes that are frankly probably a little overwhelming when I'm
                                excited about something.<br />
                                In that regard, this is kind of a quiet place for me to do that, where I can make entire
                                spaces dedicated to things I'd love to go on a tangent about. <br />
                                On one level, its giving it a place to flow. On the other level, it's giving me
                                essentially the equivalent of physical presentation materials for when I want to show
                                something something I like or that continues to eat at my mind like a worm. <br />
                                This site is my worms, please enjoy them as they wriggle in the earth and keep me awake
                                at night.
