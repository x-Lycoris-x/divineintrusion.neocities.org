                <p>I met Ivy in 2011, hiding herself under my mother's car to keep warm in the cold. Over the course of
                    the next month or so, I would regularly leave out food and sit on our back porch where she was
                    frequently spotted and allowed her to sit in my lap when she felt comfortable. Over that month it
                    became harder and harder to let her wander back out through the hole in our fence, and eventually I
                    had to convince our mother to allow us to hang onto her. Once the sliding back door was opened, and
                    she came in, I haven't let her out since.</p>

                <p>Jamie came to me through a friend currently undergoing her vet school classes, and volunteering at
                    the shelter in our area. Jamie was given to a friend of hers' clinic after his owner was put into a
                    hospice facility and he could not come with. Due to his age, and being front declawed, he was
                    scheduled to be euthanized if not picked up that week. I absolutely begged my friend to drive me the
                    two hour round trip to bring the little guy home. He perches like a gargoyle when he cuddles (ow),
                    but he's nonetheless one of the most affectionate little guys I've had the pleasure to know since
                    then.</p>
