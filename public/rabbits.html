                    <h2>Who are these people? (Preface)</h2>
                    <p>Admittedly, I'm incredibly unfamiliar with the specific history of Fantrials in the ARG space.
                        This page will be more so a set of shrines to the rabbits I've played in fantrials over the
                        years, since they have a special place in my heart (one of them being directly linked to how I
                        met my partner, Bio).
                        <br>
                        In the future, I would love to do a dive on the specific history of ARGs and fantrials, but
                        that's an undertaking for a different day beyond the <a
                            href="https://www.reddit.com/r/HobbyDrama/comments/hepjz0/everymanhybrid_faneventsfantrials_gamejackers/">somewhat
                            drama filled bare minimum history</a>.
                    </p>
                    <p>From here onward, unless something changes, I won't be participating in any more fantrials to
                        focus on <mark>other projects</mark>.</p>

                    <p>Fun fact, I'm also one of the co runners of the <a

                        There's some wild shit out there, and I welcome you to read up on the stories people have
                        submitted!</p>

                    <p><strong>Rabbit Overview:</strong> █████ was my first "rabbit" for trials environments. She was
                        16-17 at the time of her trial, matching the fact that she was a <i>slightly</i> altered self
                        insert at the time. My introduction to the "trials" world took place under a Darkiplier and
                        Antisepticeye lense, which really is just fitting for me isn't it. This trial ran to nearly its
                        conclusion, with some last minute fallings out among the mod team prematurely initiating, and
                        then abandoning the ending event. As a result ██████ remains alive, though in a severely altered
                        state from which she entered the trials.</p>

                    <p><strong>Rabbit Overview:</strong> Nicholi began as a fan oc for the Spirit Hunter (then only
                        known as Death Mark) franchise. In my spare time during my senior year of high school, I was
                        either obsessing over the series or using any of the many OCs I made for the game in other
                        environments. I had very few irl friends during that time due to moving to Texas in my senior
                        year against my wishes, so it became my primary way of connecting with others online through
                        trial spaces or the Death Mark Discord I was heavily a part of at the time. This rabbit holds a
                        special place in my heart, since through his (now defunct) tumblr, a very special ARG found its
                        way to me and led to my current state of affairs. I hold his trial singularly responsible for
                        allowing me to escape an incredibly abusive home situation and lead a proper adult life due to
                        the connections I made in this community. This trial, sadly, ended without much fanfare after
                        the runner experienced massive burnout and ended the project early.</p>

                        very disinterested in this one or it just never picked up off the ground. Sometimes these things

                        Habit in sight! A trials revolving around a story, monsters and people with supernatural gifts.
                        Len was my charming werewolf with an older sister. Another Spirit Hunter OC, though his lore in
                        this greatly differed from the source material. I unfortunately had to abandon this ARG
                        partially due to inactivity, and partially because I ended up becoming homeless that year and
                        had to prioritize other aspects of my life. I'm sad to say I never got to see the outcome of his
                        particular story, but you will likely see him as a figurehead of other projects. I just love him
                        too much not to give him a spotlight~.</p>

                        the Spirit Hunter series. Athena comes from a currently on hold project of mine Divine Intrusion
                        (which is actually where this blog got its name from!) This trial was sadly, rendered inactive
                        after its second trial, as well as the reason the Black Rose Society also fell through for me
                        personally. She's actually the antagonist of her source material, and I'd be very excited to
                        play her somewhere again in a form more authentic to her original post opening self.</p>

                    <p><strong>Rabbit Overview:</strong> Milo is a rather strange example of a rabbit, I wouldn't
                        consider him one for certain had I not put him in the same folder as the others. This trial I
                        remember little of, and frankly all the better for it. I vacated due to my ex (who turned out to
                        be a pedophile) being a participant in these trials. I wanted as little to do with them as
                        possible frankly, and still do. Gross ass bitch.</p>

                    <p><strong>Rabbit Overview:</strong> Damien is actually from the same project as Athena!!! How
                        exciting to get to stretch my legs again! Unfortunately this project is on again and off again,
                        and I admit, I got severely confused and overwhelmed by the amount of people after not being in
                        that kind of environment for so long. <mark>A certain other project</mark> certainly spoiled my
                        brain. While it is currently active, I'm admittedly a little too scared to rejoin the
                        conversation, so Damien sits in this quiet, awkward limbo as it stands. He might be one of the
                        few rabbits I end up having die in the post trial lore, purely for my own negligence making a
                        muck of things....</p>
                    <p><strong>Update:</strong> So the trials got prematurely canceled. I guess that solves that
                        issue...</p>
